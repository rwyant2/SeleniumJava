"# SeleniumJava" 

9Nov2017

Over the past several weeks, I put together this project for using Selenium with Java to test SpringBootProject. Features include:

☑ Configurable to be ran locally or on Selenium Grid.
☑ Produces error reports using TestNG and takes screenshots of failures.
☑ Can be ran from either Eclipse or IntelliJ.
☑ Gauge support included.

Upcoming features include:
☑ Multiple runs at once on different OS/browser combinations.
☑ Further reporting enhancements.
☑ Web services testing a'la SoapUI.
☑ More efficient use of GitHub. Do you really need all the object code? I don't think so.
