"# SeleniumJava" 

21Jul2018

Wow. It has been a while. I was involved with some intensive projects over the first half of 2018. I have been working on this as I could. I home this gives an accurate depiction of my skills or at the very least gives you a sensible chuckle at everything I'm doing wrong.

Accomplishments (the branch for some of this is still w.i.p.):<br/>
☑ Migrated to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS as a development environment.<br/>
☑ Scripts can be ran locally on Ubuntu.<br/>
☑ Instead of an options.txt file, options are now set on a .csv spreadsheet.<br/>
☑ Blank lines and lines starting with "//" are ignored. This allows spacing and "commenting" so I don't have to re-arrange the .csv when I code on the bus and not using Selenium Grid.<br/>
☑ Testng.xml "file" is built dynamically as a class in GrandpaBless now. Which calls, PapaBless. Which the test classes are extending. Speaking of which, it would be interesting to hear H3H3's reaction to the current controversy around John Schnatter. I watch too much YouTube.<br/>
☑ Installed the Dell DVD Store on the new Ubuntu environment using PostgreSQL. Tables, schemas, and data are on the laptop, but not here. If you're interested: http://linux.dell.com/dvdstore/ <br/>
<br/>
Dropping:<br/>
☹ IntelliJ support. I want to branch out into other languages and Eclipse supports C++, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc. I'd rather just have one IDE. I follow KISS. The anacronym, not the band. I have mixed feelings about Peter Criss. Still.<br/>
☹ Gauge support. There seems to be more support for Cucumber and the last time I saw an Eclipse plug in for that it was updated three years ago. While Gauge was fun to use, it's experience is transferrable to Cucumber.<br/>

To Dos:<br/>
☐ Fix gracefully erroring out when goofy params are in the .csv using SkipException.<br/>
☐ Finish setting up a Ubuntu 18.04 node.<br/>
☐ Upgrading dev environment to Ubuntu 18.04.<br/>
☐ Getting reporting and screenshots to work correctly when running GrandpaBless instead of a TestNG suite.<br/>
☐ Clean up the git by getting rid of old output files and leftovers from features I am dropping.<br/>
☐ Coming up with a smarter commit/push process instead of "just dump everything to get it done."<br/>
<br/>
Upcoming features I would like to include someday before I retire and/or die. Take all of this with a grain of salt:<br/>
☐ Creating an Appium demo. I am currently in gentlemanly disagreements with npm and NodeJs over getting it installed.<br/>
☐ A recent TCTAG presentation gave me an idea for a testing tool I could take from job to job using what I've already learned.<br/>
☐ Using the Dell DVD Store to mimick an on-line shopping app via the browser and a mobile app, including an API that works with the sample database.<br/>
☐ Selenium integration with SoapUI projects.<br/>
☐ Selenium/Appium demos in C++, Ruby, and Python.<br/>
☐ SQL/ETL demos using PostgreSQL.<br/>
☐ Use Jenkins and/or Chef as an CI/CD tool. I change code, check it in, it drops and runs smokes automagically.</br>
☐ Learning how to performance test. I suck at that.<br/>
☐ IoT fun tiems with NodeRed.<br/>
