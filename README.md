The next full update is going to happen 02Sep2018. I have a couple of job interviews tomorrow that are interested in Cucumber experience. I worked with Gauge, which is similar. I challenged myself to learn enough about Cucumber to get something out on the portfolio. So here it is for you to witness in awe and/or ridicule and scoff at. :-O<br>
<br>
Thanks be to <a href="http://www.automationtestinghub.com/cucumber-data-table/">AutomationTestingHub's tutorial</a>. Pretty easy to follow and very recent.<br>
<br>
<b>In today's episode:</b><br>
<br>
<b>â˜‘ New repo for Cucumber.</b> It has three tests, one from the tutorial and two that test the SpringBootProject. It's very basic compared to SeleniumJava. It only uses Chrome on the local machine. It's enough to learn how passing in parameters and data tables work. My Gauge work consisted largely of cases like this.<br>
<br>
I also came across a better Collection type for mimicing a database table. Would be nice to experiment with that in the SeleniumJava project. Might be in the next update or two.<br>
<br>
Wish me luck tomorrow. Or... maybe just hire me? :^)<br>
