"# SeleniumJava" 

9Nov2017

Over the past several weeks, I put together this project for using Selenium with Java to test SpringBootProject. Features include:<br/>

☑ Configurable to be ran locally or on Selenium Grid.<br/>
☑ Produces error reports using TestNG and takes screenshots of failures.<br/>
☑ Can be ran from either Eclipse or IntelliJ.<br/>
☑ Gauge support included.<br/>
<br/>
Upcoming features include:<br/>
☑ Multiple runs at once on different OS/browser combinations.<br/>
☑ Further reporting enhancements.<br/>
☑ Web services testing a'la SoapUI.<br/>
☑ More efficient use of GitHub. Do you really need all the object code? I don't think so.<br/>
